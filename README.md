# bestBus

Working to improve the experience of bus users, we created the concept of the best bus travel, that consider a bus route, the user departure time at the bus stop and the date.
Since we have the historical bus travels, we can infer if it's better for the user to hurry and take the previous bus, or the one in his plans or to wait and take the next travel.

To achieve the concept of the best travel, we created this project with the intention of:
- implementing the concept of the best bus travel
- modularize BusMonitor private project
- create functions to help the development
- documenting the code
